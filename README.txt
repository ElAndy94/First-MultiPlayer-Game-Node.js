SETUP for the snakegame.

1) Create the database "phpdb" manually
2) Run the setup.php page to create the tables 
3) Populate the database with the SQL file

Username: Admin
Password: Admin1

Username: Andrew
Password: Andrew1

Username: Joshwa
Password: Joshwa1

Those are three users which are connected to my database. 
If any problems occur, in the rnmembers table a user or password needs to be created, if for some reason you cant retrieve the data in my database. 

The controls are the arrow keys, also works with clicks and touch with mobile phone.
